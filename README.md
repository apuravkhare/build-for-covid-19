# Inspiration
The need to stay home and reduce the number of people in public places has become increasingly vital with every passing day. Inspired by the idea of car pools and helpful friends, we came up with the idea for an app to connect two strangers so as to reduce the number of people who have to go out for groceries and medicine by 50%.

# What it does
With our primary focus being on high risk groups for whom shopping for necessities during this time is dangerous, this app connects two people - a volunteer and a request based on location. A request can be made in one of the following categories:

- Groceries (users specify the items they need) 
- Prescription (a picture of the prescription is required)
- Delivering an item (the item details such as the weight are required)
- Other pickup

A volunteer can choose to help in one or more of these categories. Users are matched based on their location and preference, and can contact each other via phone through the app.

# Dev notes and dependencies:
- Built off the 'minimal' react native template. Make sure that Node 12 or greater is installed, then install Expo.
- To run the app, navigate to the project folder, and run 'expo start'
- Make sure that the phone and the dev machine are connected to the same network (if using LAN). For 'tunnel' mode, make sure that USB tethering is turned on on the device.
