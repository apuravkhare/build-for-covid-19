# build-for-covid-19

Notes and dependencies:
- Built off the 'minimal' react native template. Make sure that Node 12 or greater is installed, then install Expo.
- To run the app, navigate to the project folder, and run 'expo start'
- Make sure that the phone and the dev machine are connected to the same network (if using LAN). For 'tunnel' mode, make sure that USB tethering is turned on on the device.
